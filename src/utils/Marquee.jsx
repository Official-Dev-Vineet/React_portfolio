    `“If You Think Math is Hard Try Web Design.” - Pixxelznet`,
    `“The public is more familiar with bad design than good design. It is, in effect, conditioned to prefer bad design, because that is what it lives with. The new becomes threatening, the old reassuring.” - Paul Rand`,
    `“There are three responses to a piece of design - yes, no, and WOW! Wow is the one to aim for” - Milton Glaser

    `“If you want a great site, you've got to test. After you've worked on a site for even a few weeks, you can't see it fresh anymore. You know too much. The only way to find out if it really works is to test it.” - Steve Krug`,
    `“The problem is there are no simple 'right' answers for most Web design questions (at least not for the important ones). What works is good, integrated design that fills a need - carefully thought out, well-executed, and tested.” - Steve Krug
